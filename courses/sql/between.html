        <p><b>Notice that the BETWEEN operator can produce different result in different databases!<br></b>In some databases, BETWEEN selects fields that are between and excluding the test values.<br>In other databases, BETWEEN selects fields that are between and including the test values.<br>And in other databases, BETWEEN selects fields between the test values, including the first test value and excluding the 
        last test value.</p>
        <p><strong>Therefore: Check how your database treats the BETWEEN operator!</strong></p>
